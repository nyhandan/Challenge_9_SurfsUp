# Challenge 9 SurfsUp
Attempt 1 Dan Nyhan


## Purpose
W. Avy wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop in Oahu, Hawaii. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

Using Python, Pandas functions and methods, and SQLAlchemy, I filtered the date column of the Measurements table in the hawaii.sqlite database to retrieve all the temperatures for the month of June and December. Then I converted those temperatures to a list, created a DataFrame from the list, and generated the summary statistics.

Deliverable 1 is the June dataframe, and Deliverable 2 is the December dataframe. 

## Results
June summary statistics:
